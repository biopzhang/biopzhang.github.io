I study biophysics of protein-protein interaction using statistical physics and computational modelling. My research interest extends to bioinformatics, especially in developing machine learning and deep learning tools for RNA-seq analyses. I am currently a research associate in Dr. <a href="https://guangyuwanglab.github.io/web/index.html#">Guangyu Wang</a>'s computational biology and bioinformatics lab in Houston Methodist Research Institute.
