abstract = {Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell {RNA} sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed {OmiCLIP}, a visual–omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into ‘sentences’ by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train {OmiCLIP} integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on {OmiCLIP}, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk {RNA} sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.},

abstract = {Proteins' flexibility is a feature in communicating changes in cell signaling instigated by binding with secondary messengers, such as calcium ions, associated with the coordination of muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. When binding with the disordered parts of a protein, calcium ions must balance their charge states with the shape of calcium‐binding proteins and their versatile pool of partners depending on the circumstances they transmit. Accurately determining the ionic charges of those ions is essential for understanding their role in such processes. However, it is unclear whether the limited experimental data available can be effectively used to train models to accurately predict the charges of calcium‐binding protein variants. Here, we developed a chemistry‐informed, machine‐learning algorithm that implements a game theoretic approach to explain the output of a machine‐learning model without the prerequisite of an excessively large database for high‐performance prediction of atomic charges. We used the ab initio electronic structure data representing calcium ions and the structures of the disordered segments of calcium‐binding peptides with surrounding water molecules to train several explainable models. Network theory was used to extract the topological features of atomic interactions in the structurally complex data dictated by the coordination chemistry of a calcium ion, a potent indicator of its charge state in protein. Our design created a computational tool of {CaXML}, which provided a framework of explainable machine learning model to annotate ionic charges of calcium ions in calcium‐binding proteins in response to the chemical changes in an environment. Our framework will provide new insights into protein design for engineering functionality based on the limited size of scientific data in a genome space.},

Conventional RNA velocity models infer universal kinetics from all cells in an scRNA-seq experiment, resulting in unpredictable performance in experiments with multi-stage and/or multi-lineage transition of cell states where the assumption of the same kinetic rates for all cells no longer holds. Here we present cellDancer, a scalable deep neural network that locally infers velocity for each cell from its neighbors and then relays a series of local velocities to provide single-cell resolution inference of velocity kinetics. In the simulation benchmark, cellDancer shows robust performance in multiple kinetic regimes, high dropout ratio datasets and sparse datasets. We show that cellDancer overcomes the limitations of existing RNA velocity models in modeling erythroid maturation and hippocampus development. Moreover, cellDancer provides cell-specific predictions of transcription, splicing and degradation rates, which we identify as potential indicators of cell fate in the mouse pancreas. cellDancer enables RNA velocity estimation with cell-specific kinetics.},

We employed stopped-flow experiments and coarse-grained molecular simulations that learn the coordination chemistry of Ca2+ in CaM from first-principle calculations. The associative memories as part of the coarse-grained force fields built on known protein structures further influence CaM’s selection of its polymorphic target peptides in the simulations. We modeled the peptides from the Ca2+/CaM-binding domain of Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), CaMKIIp (293–310) and selected distinctive mutations at the N-terminus. Our stopped-flow experiments have shown that the CaM’s affinity for Ca2+ in the bound complex of Ca2+/CaM/CaMKIIp decreased significantly when Ca2+/CaM bound to the mutant peptide (296-AAA-298) compared to that bound to the wild-type peptide (296-RRK-298). The coarse-grained molecular simulations revealed that the 296-AAA-298 mutant peptide destabilized the structures of Ca2+-binding loops at the C-domain of CaM (c-CaM) due to both loss of electrostatic interactions and differences in polymorphic structures. We have leveraged a powerful coarse-grained approach to advance a residue-level understanding of the reciprocal relation in CaM, that could not be possibly achieved by other computational approaches.},

However, because the performance of OPV devices is still disappointing compared to their inorganic counterparts, better understanding of how controlling the molecular-level morphology can impact performance is needed. To this end, one has to overcome significant challenges that stem from the complexity and heterogeneity of the underlying electronic structure and molecular morphology. In this Letter, we address this challenge in the context of the DBP/C70 OPV system by employing a modular workflow that combines recent advances in electronic structure, molecular dynamics, and rate theory. We show how the wide range of interfacial pairs can be classified into four types of interfacial donor–acceptor geometries and find that the least populated interfacial geometry gives rise to the fastest charge transfer (CT) rates.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-binding protein that transduces signals to downstream proteins through target binding upon calcium binding in a time-dependent manner. Understanding the target binding process that tunes CaM’s affinity for the calcium ions (Ca 2+ ), or vice versa, may provide insight into how Ca 2+ -CaM selects its target binding proteins. However, modeling of Ca 2+ -CaM in molecular simulations is challenging because of the gross structural changes in its central linker regions while the two lobes are relatively rigid due to tight binding of the Ca 2+ to the calcium-binding loops where the loop forms a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with Ca 2+ . This feature that underlies the reciprocal relation between Ca 2+ binding and target binding of CaM, however, has yet to be considered in the structural modeling. Here, we presented a coarse-grained model based on the Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure, and Energy Model (AWSEM) protein force field, to investigate the salient features of CaM. Particularly, we optimized the force field of CaM and that of Ca 2+ ions by using its coordination chemistry in the calcium-binding loops to match with experimental observations. We presented a “community model” of CaM that is capable of sampling various conformations of CaM, incorporating various calcium-binding states, and carrying the memory of binding with various targets, which sets the foundation of the reciprocal relation of target binding and Ca 2+ binding in future studies.},

In this work, we observed wide variation in Ca2+ binding loop conformations of the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which adopts the most populated ternary structures determined from the MD simulations, followed by ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on all twelve amino acids in the loop that coordinate Ca2+ in aqueous solution. Ca2+ charges were derived by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP) in the context of a classical or polarizable force field (PFF). We discovered that the atomic radius of Ca2+ in conventional force fields is too large for the QM calculation to capture the variation in the coordination geometry of Ca2+ in its ionic form, leading to unphysical charges. Specifically, we found that the fitted atomic charges of Ca2+ in the context of PFF depend on the coordinating geometry of electronegative atoms from the amino acids in the loop. Although nearby water molecules do not influence the atomic charge of Ca2+, they are crucial for compensating for the coordination of Ca2+ due to the conformational flexibility in the EF-hand loop. Our method advances the development of force fields for metal ions and protein binding sites in dynamic environments.},

abstract = {We have developed a computational method of atomistically refining the structural ensemble of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs) facilitated by experimental measurements using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). A major challenge surrounding this approach stems from the deconvolution of experimental CD spectra into secondary structure features of the IDP ensemble. Currently available algorithms for CD deconvolution were designed to analyze the spectra of proteins with stable secondary structures. Herein, our work aims to minimize any bias from the peptide deconvolution analysis by implementing a non-negative linear least-squares fitting algorithm in conjunction with a CD reference data set that contains soluble and denatured proteins (SDP48). The non-negative linear least-squares method yields the best results for deconvolution of proteins with higher disordered content than currently available methods, according to a validation analysis of a set of protein spectra with Protein Data Bank entries. We subsequently used this analysis to deconvolute our experimental CD data to refine our computational model of the peptide secondary structure ensemble produced by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with implicit solvent. We applied this approach to determine the ensemble structures of a set of short IDPs, that mimic the calmodulin binding domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and its 1-amino-acid and 3-amino-acid mutants. Our study offers a, to our knowledge, novel way to solve the ensemble secondary structures of IDPs in solution, which is important to advance the understanding of their roles in regulating signaling pathways through the formation of complexes with multiple partners.},

The analysis is based on an integrative approach that combines inputs from electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations and is performed in the context of the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad dissolved in an explicit tetrahydrofuran (THF) liquid solvent. Marcus theory rate constants are calculated for the multiple CT processes that occur in this system based on either polarizable or nonpolarizable force fields, parameterized using density functional theory (DFT) with either the B3LYP or the Baer-Neuhauser-Livshits (BNL) density functionals. We find that the effect of switching from nonpolarizable to polarizable force fields on the CT rates is strongly dependent on the choice of the density functional. More specifically, the rate constants obtained using polarizable and nonpolarizable force fields differ significantly when B3LYP is used, while much smaller changes are observed when BNL is used. It is shown that this behavior can be traced back to the tendency of B3LYP to overstabilize CT states, thereby pushing the underlying electronic transitions to the deep inverted region, where even small changes in the force fields can lead to significant changes in the CT rate constants. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining polarizable force fields with an electronic structure method that can accurately capture the energies of excited CT states when calculating charge-transfer rates.},

Its ability to convert solar energy to electrical excitation and charge separation energy suggests a great potential in real-world applications. The ensemble of its conformations under ambient conditions varies widely according to its electronic state. In previous work, we applied a non-polarizable model to study the conformational distribution of the molecular triad in the ground and charge separated states. However, due to the lack of polarization, which imparts subtle changes in the charge distribution on atoms, molecular simulations fail to produce accurate average dipole moments. We developed the first polarizable model for a molecular triad to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of a molecular triad in the ground state in an explicit organic solvent, tetrahydrofuran (THF). We performed first-principles electronic structure calculations of the individual components in the triad as well as THF and then fit the partial atomic charges to the electrostatic potential using the i-RESP methodology. We validated these force field parameters by comparing the thermodynamic and dynamic properties obtained from molecular dynamics simulations with those from experiments. We enhanced the sampling of the triad conformations with replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. We characterized the effects of induced polarization on the structural stability of the triad by analyzing the free energy landscapes constructed with polarizable force fields. Furthermore, by using principal component analysis, we found that the molecular triad conformations adopted a small range of torsional angles with induced polarization. The triad conformation solvated in polar solvent with a polarizable force field qualitatively agrees with that obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We investigated the impact of bound calmodulin (CaM)-target compound structure on the affinity of calcium (Ca2+) by integrating coarse-grained models and all-atomistic simulations with nonequilibrium physics. We focused on binding between CaM and two specific targets, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and neurogranin (Ng), as they both regulate CaM-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways in neurons. It was shown experimentally that Ca2+/CaM (holoCaM) binds to the CaMKII peptide with overwhelmingly higher affinity than Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM); the binding of CaMKII peptide to CaM in return increases the Ca2+ affinity for CaM. However, this reciprocal relation was not observed in the Ng peptide (Ng13–49), which binds to apoCaM or holoCaM with binding affinities of the same order of magnitude. Unlike the holoCaM-CaMKII peptide, whose structure can be determined by crystallography, the structural description of the apoCaM-Ng13–49 is unknown due to low binding affinity, therefore we computationally generated an ensemble of apoCaM-Ng13–49 structures by matching the changes in the chemical shifts of CaM upon Ng13–49 binding from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Next, we computed the changes in Ca2+ affinity for CaM with and without binding targets in atomistic models using Jarzynski’s equality. We discovered the molecular underpinnings of lowered affinity of Ca2+ for CaM in the presence of Ng13–49 by showing that the N-terminal acidic region of Ng peptide pries open the β-sheet structure between the Ca2+ binding loops particularly at C-domain of CaM, enabling Ca2+ release. In contrast, CaMKII peptide increases Ca2+ affinity for the C-domain of CaM by stabilizing the two Ca2+ binding loops. We speculate that the distinctive structural difference in the bound complexes of apoCaM-Ng13–49 and holoCaM-CaMKII delineates the importance of CaM’s progressive mechanism of target binding on its Ca2+ binding affinities.},

abstract = {Calmodulin (CaM) is a primary calcium (Ca2+)-signaling protein that specifically recognizes and activates highly diverse target proteins. We explored the molecular basis of target recognition of CaM with peptides representing the CaM-binding domains from two Ca2+-CaM-dependent kinases, CaMKI and CaMKII, by employing experimentally constrained molecular simulations. Detailed binding route analysis revealed that the two CaM target peptides, although similar in length and net charge, follow distinct routes that lead to a higher binding frustration in the CaM–CaMKII complex than in the CaM–CaMKI complex. We discovered that the molecular origin of the binding frustration is caused by intermolecular contacts formed with the C-domain of CaM that need to be broken before the formation of intermolecular contacts with the N-domain of CaM. We argue that the binding frustration is important for determining the kinetics of the recognition process of proteins involving large structural fluctuations.

abstract = {Protein–protein interactions drive most every biological process, but in many instances the domains mediating recognition are disordered. How specificity in binding is attained in the absence of defined structure contrasts with well-established experimental and theoretical work describing ligand binding to protein. The signaling protein calmodulin presents a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms for target recognition given that it interacts with several hundred different targets. By advancing coarse-grained computer simulations and experimental techniques, mechanistic insights were gained in defining the pathways leading to recognition and in how target selectivity can be achieved at the molecular level. A model requiring mutually induced conformational changes in both calmodulin and target proteins was necessary and broadly informs how proteins can achieve both high affinity and high specificity.},
